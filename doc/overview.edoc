@doc Asynchronous URL Fetch Service

The urlfetch project aims at providing a URL Fetch Service for web application
developers to make concurrent asynchronous HTTP/S requests. The service is
entirely written in Erlang and so, it leverages the robustness and scalability
of the Erlang Open Telecom Platform.
